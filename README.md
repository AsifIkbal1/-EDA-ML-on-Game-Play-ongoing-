<span style="font-size:14px; font-family:Verdana;"> Learning is meant to be fun, which is where game-based learning comes in. This educational approach allows students to engage with educational content inside a game framework, making it enjoyable and dynamic. Although game-based learning is being used in a growing number of educational settings, there are still a limited number of open datasets available to apply data science and learning analytic principles to improve game-based learning.<br>
Most game-based learning platforms do not sufficiently make use of knowledge tracing to support individual students. Knowledge tracing methods have been developed and studied in the context of online learning environments and intelligent tutoring systems. But there has been less focus on knowledge tracing in educational games.<br>
Competition host Field Day Lab is a publicly-funded research lab at the Wisconsin Center for Educational Research. They design games for many subjects and age groups that bring contemporary research to the public, making use of the game data to understand how people learn. Field Day Lab's commitment to accessibility ensures all of its games are free and available to anyone. The lab also partners with nonprofits like The Learning Agency Lab, which is focused on developing science of learning-based tools and programs for the social good.<br>
If successful, you'll enable game developers to improve educational games and further support the educators who use these games with dashboards and analytic tools. In turn, we might see broader support for game-based learning platforms.

<span style="font-size:14px; font-family:Verdana;"> This competition uses the Kaggle's time series API. Test data will be delivered in groupings that do not allow access to future data. The objective of this competition is to use time series data generated by an online educational game to determine whether players will answer questions correctly. There are three question checkpoints (level 4, level 12, and level 22), each with a number of questions. At each checkpoint, you will have access to all previous test data for that section.</span>
